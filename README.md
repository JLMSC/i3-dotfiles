# i3-dotfiles
My i3wm custom dotfiles.

## About
These are being used at least once in the `config`:
```
- CaskaydiaCove
- dmenu
- alacritty
- pulseaudio
- ranger
- scrot
- steam
- pavucontrol
- i3bar
- i3status
```

## i3status
No need to move `i3status/config` to `~/.config/i3status/`, it reads from `~/.config/i3/i3status/config`


## Colorscheme
Using [catppuccin-latte](https://github.com/catppuccin/i3)
